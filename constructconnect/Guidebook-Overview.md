Welcome to the ConstructConnect Guidebook, the central location for all documentation and information that drives how we run the company! Due to ConstructConnect's remote work environment, the need to establish consistent guidelines and support collaboration is a high priority. The way we have addressed these needs is by adopting a "Guidebook First" mentality.

If you encounter a term or phrase you are unfamiliar with, see the [Guidebook Glossary](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Scribe%20Resources/Guidebook-Glossary)!

# Guidebook First Rationale

Our concept of documentation is modeled after documentation in software development. In software, documentation is used by developers to communicate the history, function, and intention of their code and software. 

At ConstructConnect, Guidebook first means documenting all key processes, activities, and resources in a single Guidebook. Documentation should not be done as an afterthought but from the start. At first, writing down decisions, instructions, and policies in the Guidebook before acting on them may feel time-consuming and counterintuitive. It feels this way because to document in the Guidebook entails writing out the documentation, deciding where it should be posted in Guidebook, and how to integrate it with existing Guidebook content and structures. Push back on these concerns by reminding yourself having documentation will save time in the long run by streamlining training, resource hubs, and updating processes. In addition, this communication is essential to ConstructConnect's ability to continue scaling and adapting.

Our approach to Guidebook is largely inspired by a company called GitLab. They are a similarly sized software company to us. Unlike ConstructConnect, GitLab has been 100% remote since its founding. To ensure transparency in communication and to foster collaboration, they developed the "[Handbook First](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/)" approach.

GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij explains the value of the 'Handbook First' approach:

> The biggest problem is GitLab not working handbook first. We have an amazing handbook that allows us to collaborate, onboard new people, and think collectively.
>
> However, it is counterintuitive to communicate changes to the handbook. The default of people, when they wish to communicate a change, is to send a Slack message, send an email, give a presentation, or tell people in a meeting — *anything* but make a change in the handbook.
>
> It's slower for them. It's quicker to use any other form. If they make a change in the handbook, they first have to find the relevant part of the handbook, they sometimes have to adjust the handbook to make sure their change will fit in, they have to go through a technical process and a review or two, and they have to wait a bit before it's deployed.
>
> It's slower than any other option. However, it allows people that commit a change after that to build upon a change. When they take that extra time, it's building a foundation for the next thing.
>
> I think of it as bricklaying. Every piece of information is a brick. At GitLab, there is a well-structured house, and everyone adds to that one house. Because we're pretty particular on how we build it, it has a strong foundation and we can build it very high.
>
> In every other company, they send the brick into the hands of people. Everyone is receiving bricks daily that they have to add to the house they're building internally. They forget things and things are unclear. A lot of context has to be created because there is no context around where to place the bricks.
>
> So, you can end up with a thousand houses that look quite different, that are all hanging a bit, and each time you add a brick to the top one pops out at the bottom. — *GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij*

Sid's reference to bricklaying is the most important part here. Solid documentation prevents getting bogged down in repetitive rework.

Here's a short video that highlights how we intend to use the Guidebook at ConstructConnect, which is spelled out in greater detail in the text below.

The Handbook First approach has a few key characteristics that went on to inspire Guidebook:

- Write everything down
- Single source of truth
- Anyone can contribute

Let's break down some of these key characteristics a little further!

# Guidebook Core Principles
This section will explore how writing everything down, creating a single source of truth, and allowing all ConstructConnect team members to contribute have created the foundation of the Guidebook First approach!

## Write Everything Down
There are a few key advantages to writing things down:

- **Scale**: Rather than explaining to every new manager how to use a requisition system, write it down once and let them read it. 

- **Clarity**: Writing doesn't guarantee sound logic, but it goes a long way toward exposing the lack of sound logic.

- **Asynchronous**: Team members can consume documentation at a time and pace that is convenient to them.

Still not sure? Use the following table to see how these advantages will help you in your daily workflow!

| Scale | Clarity | Asynchronous |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retention is better when standards and expectations are transparent and readily viewable to new team members. | On-boarding is easier if you can review the information at your own pace. | For some, reading is much faster than listening. |
| Teamwork becomes easier when you can read about how other parts of the organization operate. | Discussing changes is easier when you can readily reference the current process. | You don't have to interrupt somebody or rely on their availability to answer a question. |
| Everyone can contribute to Guidebook to fill in gaps in knowledge. | Communicating change is easier when you can link to a page that shows exactly what was changed (the diff). |  | 

The above section explained that the process of logging the history and development of processes is something that the software development community at large has already adopted. This same section also stated that learning to write things down before anything else can be hard to do. To start getting in the habit of writing everything down, follow this flow structure:

1. Somebody asks a question or brings up a process-related question in a meeting or a chat.
1. Propose the question and answer to the question be added to Guidebook via a Pull Request or by reaching out to your team scribe.
1. Once a policy or process owner has approved and merged a pull request, announce the change by linking to the diff in the commit on Bitbucket. Post the diff in the chat where the problem originally arose or include it on the agenda for a follow-up meeting.

If you need to edit or collaborate in real-time on a Guidebook entry, draft it in a OneDrive document. At the top of this document include a link to the section of the Guidebook the information will be migrated to once it is complete.

## Single Source of Truth
Maintaining documentation in one location prevents confusion and rework. Most importantly, to quote the [GitLab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/), the single source of truth creates a "virtuous cycle of self-searching, self-service, and self-learning." When robust documentation exists in one location, team members can begin to assume that their questions have already been answered, allowing them reliably to look to the documentation for answers.

To start getting in the habit of developing a single source of truth cross-link information rather than copy and pasting it. If you need to move content from one location to another remove it from its original location and replace it with a link to the new Guidebook location. Duplicate content leads to everybody having to do more work in the following ways:

1. It requires you to update out-of-date content in multiple places.
1. It requires you to remember all of the places information is housed when updates need to be made.
1. It makes it harder for users to know where to look for answers to their questions.

To create a Single Source of Truth, information needs to be stored in a single system. Cross-link items that are related but must be documented in separate locations rather than rewriting them. Although platforms such as TransformU and SharePoint allow you to store documentation they should all be [used for their distinct purposes](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Documentation-Decision-Guide). We do not encourage using these instead of the Guidebook for the following reasons:

- Information that is not stored on Guidebook cannot be searched. Even if a link is provided in the Guidebook to a document in another location, its discoverability is dependent on what keywords you include in the hyperlink and what users type in the search bar.
- Files stored on other platforms can be downloaded to the user's computer. This presents a few problems:
    - Downloaded documents can be shared outside of the ConstructConnect network via email.
	- People can edit content in a local copy creating confusion.
	- Reliance is created on saved files rather than dynamic, online content.

Posting the majority if not all documentation on Guidebook has several benefits:

- Information has a consistent look. People can rely on the format and layout of each page to be consistent.
- It drives users to rely on online resources that are curated rather than referencing out of date information on their computer.
- Users don't have to be encouraged to replace documents they have downloaded. They can instead bookmark a Guidebook page and get immediate and automatic updates.
	- Remember, it is impossible to retract or replace a document once it is downloaded.

## Anyone Can Contribute

Every employee should feel empowered to participate in the process of continuous improvements. For example, Toyota does this by giving employees the power to shut down the assembly line if they see a quality defect. ConstructConnect does this with transparent documentation of processes. By writing down what we do, anybody can draft a change or suggestion (pull request in software terminology) to that process. This doesn't guarantee that the change will be made, but it opens the door for employees to participate.

There are several ways that team members may contribute to Guidebook:

1. Become a [scribe](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Scribe%20Training/Scribe-Training) and learn to use the [Guidebook Tools](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Scribe%20Training/Guidebook-Tools).
1. Attend [Guidebook Office Hours](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Scribe%20Resources/Guidebook-Office-Hours).
1. Communicate questions, concerns, and ideas with team scribes.
1. Work in a [Guidebook First](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Working-Guidebook-First) manner.

### How Can You Contribute?

#### Determining if Information Is Missing

Before you report any information as missing, use the search features built into Guidebook to confirm you can't find the information you desire. Please search key terms in the search bar, search tags, and use the repository table of contents to confirm nothing is already documented. Once you have confirmed the information is not available or searchable in Guidebook, you start thinking about who your request should go to.

#### Requesting Documentation Addititions

Contributions can be made by becoming a scribe or by giving feedback on the content that is in Guidebook. If you notice a gap, helping fill that gap [helps us come closer to having a Single Source of Truth](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook-Iteration). This section of the page will walk you through what to do with your feedback or who to approach when you notice missing information.

#### Adding Information to Guidebook

1. **Become a Scribe**
	- Becoming a Guidebook Scribe is the most direct way to make a contribution to the Guidebook. If you are interested in becoming a scribe to add information to the Guidebook, complete the [Scheduling Training](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Scribe%20Training/Scribe-Training#scheduling-training) of the [Scribe Training Page](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Scribe%20Training/Scribe-Training#scribe-training) page.
1. **Talk to a Team Scribe**
	- If you are not able to take scribe training at the time you find the information or the information needs to be added urgently, reaching out to a team scribe is your next best option. You can find a full listing of company scribes on the [General Landing Page](/pages/general/Welcome%20to%20ConstructConnect%20General%20Documentation#scribes).
	- Talk to your Team Lead to let them know that you and a team scribe will be working on this. This will prevent inaccurate or duplicate information from being published. 
1. **Talk to your P&C Business Partner**
	- If you are looking to add a policy or something that will affect the organization as a whole, reach out to your [P&C Business Partner](/pages/peopleandculture/People%20and%20Culture/Business%20Partners/People%20and%20Culture%20Business%20Partners#who-is-my-p-c-business-partner).
1. **Get in Touch With the Guidebook Administrator**
	- If you aren't sure how to proceed or are interested in learning more, please reach out to the [Guidebook Administrator](mailto:elizabeth.packard@constructconnect.com).

#### Note on Core Principles

These characteristics will, particularly at first, be aspirational rather than strict rules. We can't stop our existing responsibilities until we have documented every process. And of course, use your discretion and common sense when contributing. We don't need to document how to place a phone call or search your email. Things that are obvious, generic, or easily searchable don't need to be documented. The last thing we want to do is create a sea of useless content that obscures the important stuff. The single source of truth, likewise, is aspirational. We aren't going to decommission TransformU and there are always going to be sensitive materials that can't be shared within the Guidebook. That said, our goal should be to put content into the Guidebook - and only the Guidebook - whenever possible. On a related note, hyperlinks are our friends. As an example, we can place links on TransformU that point to content in the Guidebook. Likewise, we can place links in the Guidebook to content that lives externally (because of sensitivity, format, or because it simply hasn't been moved to the Guidebook yet).

# Guidebook Creation at ConstructConnect

The Guidebook was created to become the central location for policies, processes, procedures, and other general best practices and information.

On the Guidebook landing page, you will find a policy-specific section with both company-wide and team-specific policies that you should familiarize yourself with. Within this Policy section, you will find sub-sections that will help you determine which policies apply to specific teams or ConstructConnect as a whole. If you want to keep up-to-date with updates and additions to this repository, please see the [Monthly Policy Release Notes]( /pages/policy/Construct%20Connect%20Policy%20Documentation/Monthly%20Policy%20Updates) page. The policy section has the most limited number of contributors, and if you wish to propose a change to this repository you must follow the formal approval process for [Creating Policy](/pages/policy/Construct%20Connect%20Policy%20Documentation/Creating%20Policy).

Each team has its own location within the Guidebook, where you can share team-specific documentation, and see the team landing page that details how the team operates. The team-specific sections of Guidebook are more open for team members to edit and contribute, there is also a lighter-weight approval process. Feel free to explore documentation on other teams’ repositories, as they might have resources and information that can be used across teams.

Eventually, we aim to make Guidebook a place team members will visit daily or as frequently as necessary because team members will be able to assume their questions have been answered in its documentation. 

## Team Scribes  

For assistance with creating or updating Guidebook documentation please contact a Team Scribe . You can find a curated list of team scribes on the [Comprehensive Scribe List](/pages/general/General/How%20We%20Engage%20and%20Communicate/Guidebook/Scribe%20Resources/Comprehensive-Scribe-List)!
